					<p>My name is Kevin Christensen and I have been with Waubonsie Mental Health for two years now.

Over the last twenty years I have primarily worked with youth in residential treatment settings and on probation and spent 12 of those years working in the Admissions office at Clarinda Academy.  I have a love for traveling and my previous job allowed to me to “officially say” I have passed through 32 different states either by plane or by car. In my off time, I enjoy spending time camping and fishing, and this time of year watching college football…I am a huge Iowa Hawkeyes fan. What I enjoy most about this job is watching people succeed with their goals and being able to help with life throws a curveball!</p>

					<p>There is truly something about hope that causes a person to look forward and focus on things that are possible.  Hope helps individuals face barriers that have limited their choices and ability to move forward with healthier choices.  Waubonsie has supported many people in facing the barriers and offered supports to move forward.  It is a privilege to be part of a team of providers who promote healthy change, encourage whole health lifestyle, and assist individuals in ways to manage obstacles.  Being a part of the Waubonsie Integrated Health Home team has broadened my understanding of what a great community we live in, of tremendous resources aimed at meeting the needs of individuals, and personally assisted me in growing in my understanding that change is possible for everyone. </p>
