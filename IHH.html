In my off time, I enjoy spending time camping and fishing, and this time of year watching college football…I am a huge Iowa Hawkeyes fan.

					<h2>Jean Miller, BS</h2>
					<h4>IHH Care Coordinator</h4>
					<p>There is truly something about hope that causes a person to look forward and focus on things that are possible.  Hope helps individuals face barriers that have limited their choices and ability to move forward with healthier choices.  Waubonsie has supported many people in facing the barriers and offered supports to move forward.  It is a privilege to be part of a team of providers who promote healthy change, encourage whole health lifestyle, and assist individuals in ways to manage obstacles.  Being a part of the Waubonsie Integrated Health Home team has broadened my understanding of what a great community we live in, of tremendous resources aimed at meeting the needs of individuals, and personally assisted me in growing in my understanding that change is possible for everyone. </p>
