					<h1>Supported Community Living</h1>
				<h2>What is Supported Community Living (SCL)?</h2>
				<p>Like CSS, Supported Community Living also provides home and community-based support to individuals living with serious, persistent mental illness. Together with their assigned Supported Community Living Worker, clients in this program work to develop coping and life skills needed to participate more fully in their communities.!</p>
				<h2>Where can I get this service?</h2>
				<p>Page, Fremont, and Montgomery Counties.</p>
				<h2>Who is eligable to recieve this service?</h2>
				<p>This service is available to adults living in the counties listed above, with a history of psychiatric treatment more intensive than outpatient care, more than once in their lifetime, that are in need of assistance/additional supports in order to function in their community. Iowa Medicaid or regional funding are required for eligibility.</p>

					<h1>SCL </h1>
					<h2>Roxy Smith</h2>
					<h4>SCL Provider</h4>
					<p>My name is Roxy Smith. I have lived in Clarinda for over 40 years, having moved here after graduating high school in Illinois. I have worked in food service for many years. I then worked with adjudicated youth for 12 years. I loved working with kids and helping them. I am a people person. I enjoy being able to help others with their needs. Even if it is just sitting down and having a conversation with them. Making people smile is always what makes me smile.</p>
