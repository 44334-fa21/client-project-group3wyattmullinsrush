					<h3>Stephanie Gray, ARNP</h3>
					<p>I earned a bachelor’s degree in Nursing from Nebraska Methodist College in 1996. I then earned a master’s degree in the Family Practice Nurse Practitioner program from Creighton University in 2004. I went on from there to earn a post-master’s certificate in Psychiatry from Creighton University in 2006. I have extensive experience in the Emergency Department delivering medical care as well as Psychiatric care. I have practiced in close to every level of psychiatric care available which brings a seasoned and well-rounded view into my practice abilities. I have a very special interest in Individuals with intellectual disabilities and co-morbid psychiatric illnesses. I enjoy the autonomy that my dual licensures provide for me. However, I am also a collaborator with many other disciplines, as they say, “it takes a village”. Although, I have carried these advanced degrees for an extended period of time, I am a nurse and love to teach students at all levels…. Empower those that are our future!
